## What this project does
* This project studies distributed deep learning in cloud environments by reproducing and analyzing the key ideas from the paper OptiReduce: Resilient and Tail-Optimal AllReduce for Distributed Deep Learning in the Cloud.
* Because we do not have access to a real commercial cloud, we build a cloud-like environment using our own machines. Our goal is not raw performance, but understanding and reproducing cloud behaviors that the paper targets.
